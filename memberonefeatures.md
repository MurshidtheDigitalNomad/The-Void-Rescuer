# Feature Summary

- Spaceflight core: physics-based ship with thrust, rotation, drag, fuel consumption, and power adjustment.
- Hazard/attraction: central black hole with gravity, event horizon loss, and warning cues when close.
- Rescue targets: astronauts in orbit with tether mechanics, rescue via station pad and optional rescue gate scoring.
- Environment: starfield backdrop, random asteroids with varied sizes/shapes/rotation, rescue station pad rendering.
- Difficulty system: easy/medium/hard presets controlling astronauts, asteroids, fuel, thrust, and consumption; auto-advance through levels after victory.
- HUD: speed, power, fuel, rescue counts, gate distance/score, required power hints, victory/game-over/pause messaging, and current level label on the right.
- Game loop and controls: WASD/arrow navigation, P/O power tweaks, space to tether, tab pause, R restart, ESC quit; victory and game-over flows with restart and campaign completion messaging.
